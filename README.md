# Try React with Deno
Trying out new JS runtime DENO v1.14.2 with unstable `emit` function to compile a react component

## How to run
```bash
cd React\ Bundling/ && ./script.sh
```

The above command will run compile & start the server in watch mode. Now, if you edit the `index.tsx` file, it will auto-compile.
